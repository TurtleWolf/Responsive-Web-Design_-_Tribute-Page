                <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
                <li><strong>1436</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><strong>1439</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks
                    to a
                    Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
                    Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of
                    this left scars on me."</li>
                <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget
                    cuts.
                    Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
                    about
                    breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is
                    rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control
                    malaria,
                    disenfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant
                    wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his
                    team
                    breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent
                    wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling
                    American
                    breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of
                    Mexico's
                    wheat.</li>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the
                    Indian
                    subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and
                    sorghum
                    yields</li>
                <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues
                    that
                    genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
                    land.
                    Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous
                    because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we
                    called
                    it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
            </ul>
